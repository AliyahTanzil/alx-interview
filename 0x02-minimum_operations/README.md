This module contains a function that solves a coding problem.

The problem is: In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

The function minOperations(n) takes an integer n as the input and returns an integer as the output. It uses an algorithm based on finding the prime factors of n and optimizing the number of operations.
