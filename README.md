This module provides a function, `pascal_triangle`, to generate Pascal's triangle. Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. The first row consists of a single value, 1, and each subsequent row is generated by summing adjacent values from the previous row, with additional 1s at the beginning and end of each row. The `pascal_triangle` function returns an empty list if `n` is less than or equal to 0.
